Kai Sniadach Dev Log

## Sprint 1

    Initial commits, GitHub and Jira integration
    Looked through research papers to start our planning for the rest of the sprints
    Found a github that had a good looking UI for inspiration, and were given other repos for agent setup as well as their implementations of NEAT and hyperNEAT models.
    Set up initial backlog items and planned out who will take on what type of tasks (documentation, frontend, backend), this also involved planning items for later in the semester, as well as our long and short term goals.

## Sprint 2

    Set up items for each member of the team, as well as planned who will take on what tasks.
    Designed the simulation control and metric format. This involved planning tasks for rendering of the simulation, which needed to be coordinated with the work with both Jackson Salyards and Jackson Baker for their work in the GUI.
    This also involved looking through research papers to model what metrics we needed to measure fitness by (time alive, how quick a goal was achieved, etc.)
    The hurricane really ripped through us this sprint and as a result we had been set back a bit.
